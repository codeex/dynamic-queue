# About

Message Queues are very crucial part of many applications specially Enterprise and Real Time applications. There are many message broker frmeworks available in the marked e.g. RabbitMq, ZeroMq, ServiceBus and so on. Each framework has different features and usage. It is very common that in a single application you use more than one message broker. For exmaple, ZeroMq is in-memory messaging queue and it is very efficient because of this reason; so, it can be used for logging purpose in a separate thread. Or the scenario could be using free message broker in Development environment and paid one in Production. So there are many possibilities using more than one message broker.

Dynamic Queue (this framework) is an abstraction which is independent from any specific message broker implementation and gives the flexibility to switch the message broker without updating the code. YES!!!
